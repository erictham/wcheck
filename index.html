		This web-based tool allows the user to make depth level searches on entities
		based on the WorldCheck database and the DataFusion data sources.
		It is built for demonstration and Proof of Concept purposes. At present, it
		is configured for 1MDB, but can be easily extended to any search entity.
      <ul>
		<li> How to use it? The user enters '1MDB' into the DataFusion database. 
		The DataFusion outputs a network of related news and entities that are involved in the
		saga up to the 3rd/ 4th level. So for eg, 1Malaysia Development Bhd is the first level entity
		flagged out. This is mentioned in the news article <em><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="clearAndSelect(1);">
		Update 1: Malaysian authorities freeze bank accounts linked to PM graft scandal.</a></em>
		Clicking on this link shows the news article to appear. 
		This news articles in turn raises other related entities eg  <em><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="clearAndSelect(9);">
		'Al-Zaquan Amer Hamzah' (a person).	</a></em>	
		</li>
        <li>Hover over a node to see the entity, and to highlight
        the entities related to it. Click on a node to show entity details. 
		It will open up a side panel.You can use you usual browser controls 
		to zoom and pan over the graph. If you zoom in when centred on a entity, the
        graph will expand around it. Above a certain zoom level, entity titles
		are automatically displayed for all the related entity.</li>
		<li>A related entity can also be 'searched' within the network by entering into the search box, and 
		clicking 'search'. Examples are 'Powertek Energy Sdn Bhd', 'Koong Wai Seng', 'Dennis See' etc
		</li>
      </ul>

      <dt>Network of related Entities in 1MDB Saga</dt>
      <dd>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFuqmUJbZBk">DataFusion</a> 
	  website lets users search for entities, view their details, and find out 
	  their related entities. </dd>

     The graph network shows a network of relationships related to 1MDB. The bigger the circle, the closer the original relationship to the
	 1MDB entity saga.

      <dd>Each circle is a entity - either a person or an organisation or a news event; 

		When a entity is selected (hovering or clicking) it is shown as purple
		in the network. The set of entities linked to it (the ones more similar
		to it) are also highlighted, this time in blue.<br/>

		The width of the link between two entities reflect the type of relationships eg. directorships, shareholders, or mentioned in the 
		same breadth.
		This similarity translates to the force attracting the nodes (so that two very similar entities will tend
		to stay close, within the constraints imposed by the rest of the
		forces from the other nodes).<br/>


	<dt>Heavily connected network</dt>
		<dd>The entity has several connected entities in the network <br/>
		There is a strong central cluster containing some of the most important entities 
		(it is so dense that it cannot be clearly seen unless you zoom in). Some of them are deeply connected, 
		check for instance <em><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="clearAndSelect(18);">JIMAH TEKNIK SDN BHD</a></em> or <em><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="clearAndSelect(3);">1MDB Real Estate Sdn Bhd</a></em>. 
		Within that central cluster we can also identify isolated subclusters, such as the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="clearAndSelect(7);">Falcon Bank distancing </a> itself from the saga.<br/>
